## Searching in Java

This repository stores code scripts that implement searching in Java . 

In computer science, searching is the process of finding an item with specified properties 
from a collection of items. 

The items may be stored as records in a database, simple data elements in arrays, text in files,
nodes in trees, vertices and edges in graphs, or they may be elements of other search spaces.
